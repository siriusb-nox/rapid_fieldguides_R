Rapid identificaiton guides produced by the field museum have helped accelerating the pace at which we document Earth´s biodiversity and inform the scientific and general community about it. Yet, their design and making rely on microsoft office Word templates which are cumbersome to manahge. This repository will provide a set of Rmarkdown templates to help accelerating the construction of said guides, withoiut the need of relying on paywall softwares like microsoft. 

### Guides available:
